# Amlaan

### What I did

- Scraped Wunderground API data for last 5 years
- Used RandomSearch to finetune XGBoost parameters
- Experimented with running MLP in Caffe2

### What I plan to do next week

- Data integration with Pandas, Seaborn, and Dora
- Test out Keras implementations of regression models for crime prediction
- Start on data visualization libraries

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- The main issue will be integrating data.

# Somshubra

### What I did

- Finished developing the Yelp scrapers again
- Finish creating the base framework for tests
- Scraped data from Wunderground API for Weather

### What I plan to do next week

- Finish the scraping task and submit work.
- Prepare for integration task next week
- Find some way to improve the embeddings for Deep Learning models.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- No blocks for now until integration begins.

# Debojit

### What I did
- Scraped the data sets I wanted to gather.
- Discussed more pipeline changes which seemed redundant after last week.
- Tried out some visualization frameworks anf libraries like JS Charts, High Charts and learnt a little bit of d3.js to know what it is about.

### What I plan to do next week
- Clean the scraped data and integrate it with our current directory structure
- Try to establish the connections which were discussed by us between datasets and see if they are actually feasible. This will allow us to see any holes in our ideas as well as asymmetry between datasets schemas.
- Discuss and implement atleast one Machine learning approach in addition to the other teammates efforts.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- None other than usual snags in scraping from different sites according to their HTML structure and heirarchy.
- Long tutorials for some simple concepts took some of my time which could have been done sooner with a better choice of tutorial to follow. No technical difficulty yet.

### What I did
- Scraped data from Wunderground API for weather 
- Explored and worked on understanding yelp data scrapping 
- Worked on Report 2 , and was discussed the project pipeline.
### What I plan to do next week
- Work on yelp data scrapping and presenting it.
- Understand the output from data analytics and integration phase.
- Try to explore more on the visualization and webpage aspects. 

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- Identifying the right libraries for each of the task will be an impediment.

# Debojit

### What I did
- Gathered data from Wunderground API and ran some script on it to understand it more personally
- Started building the backend service we plan on talking to using Django
- Discovered Deck.gl and tried using it to map some test maps. Discussed further UI decisions

### What I plan to do next week
- Finish basic server setup and give teammates a platform to host their respective code on

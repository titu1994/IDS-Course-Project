### What I did

- Setup project structure and core modules that will be built later
- Setup scrapers to scrape yelp.com for restaurants and bars around Chicago from the address 60601 - 60607. Scraped roughly 550~ restaurants + bars and some useful data.
- Setup scrapers to scrape yelp.com/bi for reviews based on the names of restaurants from the above dataset. Scraped roughly 50,000 reviews of nearly 280 restaurants + bars.
- Obtained Yelp Dataset for nearly 5.2 million raw reviews of various restaurants from all over the U.S. We plan to use this to supplement the final classifier to be more generalized and learn to predict sentiment based on just the text description alone.
- Setup script to call the Wunderground API to obtain nearly 4 years worth of weather data for a pin codes 60601 & 60605.
- Wrote scripts to clean and preprocess the above scraped datasets and utils to manipulate the data.

### What I plan to do next week

- Finish scraping and building the weather dataset by scraping more data for previous years.
- Setup basic preprocessing for cleaning the text reviews
- Setup basic ML baselines for Sentiment Analysis of the reviews, if time permits

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- None for the foreseeable future. However, next week will be data integration. So we need to prepare all of the other datasets asap.

# Amlaan

### What I did

- Experimented with Decision Trees and Random Forrests from Scikit
- Experimented with simple XGBoost
- Explored ways to play around with text data using NLTK

### What I plan to do next week

- Scrape Yelp and Wunderground (weather) data
- Use GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV for parameter tuning for various ML models
- Start on data visualization libraries

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- The main issue will be scraping the Yelp and Wunderground (weather) data. Cleaning the data will also require some clever tricks to avoid just dropping rows with null or invalid values.

# Somshubra

### What I did

- Improved utility scripts to cache the sentiment dataset and preprocess the text, tokenize and tf-idf normalize for Scikit Learn Machine Learning Models
- Setup oversampling techniques such as SMOTE for better sentiment analysis balance.
- Setup training scripts for sentiment analysis.
- Trained a rough sentiment embedding using FastText model to improve recognition of negative sentiment.
- Trained deep learning models for Keras sentiment analysis:
  - Attention LSTM
  - Multiplicative LSTM
  - Nested LSTM
  - Neural Architecture Search RNN Cell
  - Minimal RNN Cell
  - CNN
  - FastText
  - MLP
- Try to remove extreme positive bias from the following models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
- Scraped data from Wunderground API for Weather

### What I plan to do next week

- Setup Scrapy to scrape the details for the Yelp dataset for zip code 60604.
- Find some way to improve from the 60% f1 score for Logistic regression
- Find some way to improve the embeddings for Deep Learning models.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- No blocks for now until integration begins.

# Debojit

### What I did
- Imported and ran the scripts to collect data. Updated myself with the structure and workflow.
- Surfed the internet to decided on a few datasets.
- Designed a initial pipeline for the project and imparted it to teammates

### What I plan to do next week
- Scrape data from some sites and download a dataset I have decided on.
- Clean the scraped data into the commonly decided format.
- Discuss with teammates the required duties and responsibilities.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- None so far, except a few conditions to be decided while cleaning the data and integrating it with the other three.

# Christopher

### What I did
- Updated project structure and core modules that will be built later
- Looked at Census.Gov and CityofChicago Datasets and work related to Demographics information.
- Tried some tutorials on data extraction.

### What I plan to do next week
- Apply what has been understood for the data extraction.
- Work with the team in scrapping the yelp data as per the specifications provided.
- Learn more on visualization.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- Nothing unprecedented, like pointed above the integration of data could need some extra effort.

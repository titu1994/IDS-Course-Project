# Amlaan

### What I did

- Researched Nested LSTMs for Sentiment Analysis
- Learned about D3 visualization techniques
- Experimented with Deck GL for map data visualization

### What I plan to do next week

- More lightweight visualization techniques
- Integration of weather, Yelp data with other types of data
- Explore ways to minimize data redundancy and loss in data integration

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- None for now.

# Somshubra

### What I did

- Finish scraping full yelp dataset
- Finish scraping full Wunderground weather dataset
- Prepared the codebase for the manual reference datasets of next week

### What I plan to do next week

- See the data stored in the manual datasets.
- Prepare scripts to clean if required
- Prepare training of Sentiment models on the reference Yelp dataset when provided.
- Begin integrating the manual datasets with our collection of data.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- Will probably work on this after Tuesday due to midterm.
- Expect the integration task to go over smoothly. We will assign an integration manager to oversee this task.

# Debojit

### What I did
- Gathered data from Wunderground API and ran some script on it to understand it more personally
- Started building the backend service we plan on talking to using Django
- Discovered Deck.gl and tried using it to map some test maps. Discussed further UI decisions

### What I plan to do next week
- Finish basic server setup and give teammates a platform to host their respective code on
- Contribute to front-end solution with building user inputs using ReactJS
- Help finalise what charts are the best for which form of data and test plot it

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- Setting up some front end design and user flow
- Deck.gl seems attractive yet might not be the best solution as of now

# Christopher

### What I did
- Explored visualization libraries like D3, bokeh.
- Explored and worked on understanding yelp data scrapping
- Attended Project guidance session held by the TAs

### What I plan to do next week
- Work on the next deliverable, manual data set reference.
- Try out the relevant visualization libraries.
- Read about sentiment analysis, and ml models.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- Identifying the right libraries for each of the task will be an impediment.

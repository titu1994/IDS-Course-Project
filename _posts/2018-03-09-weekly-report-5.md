# Amlaan

### What I did

- Scraped Wunderground API data for last 5 years
- Used RandomSearch to finetune XGBoost parameters
- Experimented with running MLP in Caffe2

### What I plan to do next week

- Data integration with Pandas, Seaborn, and Dora
- Test out Keras implementations of regression models for crime prediction
- Start on data visualization libraries

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- The main issue will be integrating data.

# Somshubra

### What I did

- Finish scraping full yelp dataset
- Finish scraping full Wunderground weather dataset
- Prepared the codebase for the manual reference datasets of next week

### What I plan to do next week

- See the data stored in the manual datasets.
- Prepare scripts to clean if required
- Prepare training of Sentiment models on the reference Yelp dataset when provided.
- Begin integrating the manual datasets with our collection of data.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week

- Will probably work on this after Tuesday due to midterm.
- Expect the integration task to go over smoothly. We will assign an integration manager to oversee this task.

# Debojit

### What I did
- Gathered data from Wunderground API and ran some script on it to understand it more personally
- Started building the backend service we plan on talking to using Django
- Discovered Deck.gl and tried using it to map some test maps. Discussed further UI decisions

### What I plan to do next week
- Finish basic server setup and give teammates a platform to host their respective code on
- Contribute to front-end solution with building user inputs using ReactJS
- Help finalise what charts are the best for which form of data and test plot it

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- Setting up some front end design and user flow
- Deck.gl seems attractive yet might not be the best solution as of now

# Christopher

### What I did
- Scraped data from Wunderground API for weather
- Explored and worked on understanding yelp data scrapping
- Worked on Report 2 , and was discussed the project pipeline

### What I plan to do next week
- Work on yelp data scrapping and presenting it.
- Understand the output from data analytics and integration phase.
- Try to explore more on the visualization and webpage aspects.

### Blocks or impediments to the plan for next week
- Identifying the right libraries for each of the task will be an impediment.
